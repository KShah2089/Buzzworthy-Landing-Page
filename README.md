# Buzzworthy-Landing-Page
Here, we have attempted to make a clone of the landing page of Buzzworthy NYC (https://buzzworthystudio.com/). The main features are the scroll animation, shadow backdrop, sliding doors, and transitions between background images. While creating this project, I sharpened my knowledge on the :hover psuedo class, position property, display property, margin, and padding. I explored in-depth how to use the :before pseudo class, combinator CSS selectors, and the transition property.

The site is live here: https://kshah2089.github.io/Buzzworthy-Landing-Page/.
